# Multiple-arduino-IO
This code takes an analog joystick and photoresistor as input and has a piezo speaker, and 4 LEDs arranged along the axis of the joystick as output. 
    The code can be split into two systems. The first involves the LEDs and joystick. Each LED corresponds to each direction of the joystick and lights up according to the movement of the joystick.
    The second system plays the Pink Panther theme and speeds up if the photo resistor detects an elevated light level and slows down if the light level is lower than the recorded ambient level.
